# Real-time-Vehcile-detection-

This project demonstrates real-time vehicle detection using Python, OpenCV and Haar cascades. It uses Haar cascades to detect the presence of vehicles in a video stream from a dashboard camera or similar source.

# Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Python 3.5 or higher installed, as well as the following libraries:

OpenCV
Numpy
You can install these libraries using pip. For example:
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy

# Usage
To use the vehicle detection program, simply run the following command:
python detect_vehicles.py

This will open a video stream from your default camera and begin detecting vehicles in real-time. You can adjust the sensitivity of the vehicle detection by modifying the scaleFactor and minNeighbors parameters in the detectMultiScale function.
